- MortonKeys has to have a phantom field for carrying the precison
    - Should always be using morton constructors...
- Need to figure out which parts need real numbers only, and which parts can be generic over any scalar
- Need to implement Helmholtz FMM
    - The only bit that might break is the
        - Pinv part
    - The P2P part may be significantly slower, especially for gradients.
    - As might the other operators, M2M and L2L, as these are now both zgemm operations.
