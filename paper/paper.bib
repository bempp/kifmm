abstract = {A new O (N) fast multipole formulation is proposed for non-oscillatory kernels. This algorithm is applicable to kernels K (x, y) which are only known numerically, that is their numerical value can be obtained for any (x, y). This is quite different from many fast multipole methods which depend on analytical expansions of the far-field behavior of K, for | x - y | large. Other "black-box" or "kernel-independent" fast multipole methods have been devised. Our approach has the advantage of requiring a small pre-computation time even for very large systems, and uses the minimal number of coefficients to represent the far-field, for a given L2 tolerance error in the approximation. This technique can be very useful for problems where the kernel is known analytically but is quite complicated, or for kernels which are defined purely numerically. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Ibeid2016,
abstract = {Exascale systems are predicted to have approximately 1 billion cores, assuming gigahertz cores. Limitations on affordable network topologies for distributed memory systems of such massive scale bring new challenges to the currently dominant parallel programing model. Currently, there are many efforts to evaluate the hardware and software bottlenecks of exascale designs. It is therefore of interest to model application performance and to understand what changes need to be made to ensure extrapolated scalability. The fast multipole method (FMM) was originally developed for accelerating N-body problems in astrophysics and molecular dynamics but has recently been extended to a wider range of problems. Its high arithmetic intensity combined with its linear complexity and asynchronous communication patterns make it a promising algorithm for exascale systems. In this paper, we discuss the challenges for FMM on current parallel computers and future exascale architectures, with a focus on internode communication. We focus on the communication part only; the efficiency of the computational kernels are beyond the scope of the present study. We develop a performance model that considers the communication patterns of the FMM and observe a good match between our model and the actual communication time on four high-performance computing (HPC) systems, when latency, bandwidth, network topology, and multicore penalties are all taken into account. To our knowledge, this is the first formal characterization of internode communication in FMM that validates the model against actual measurements of communication time. The ultimate communication model is predictive in an absolute sense; however, on complex systems, this objective is often out of reach or of a difficulty out of proportion to its benefit when there exists a simpler model that is inexpensive and sufficient to guide coding decisions leading to improved scaling. The current model provides such guidance.},
