@article{Ying2004,
abstract = {We present a new fast multipole method for particle simulations. The main feature of our algorithm is that it does not require the implementation of multipole expansions of the underlying kernel, and it is based only on kernel evaluations. Instead of using analytic expansions to represent the potential generated by sources inside a box of the hierarchical FMM tree, we use a continuous distribution of an equivalent density on a surface enclosing the box. To find this equivalent density, we match its potential to the potential of the original sources at a surface, in the far field, by solving local Dirichlet-type boundary value problems. The far-field evaluations are sparsified with singular value decomposition in 2D or fast Fourier transforms in 3D. We have tested the new method on the single and double layer operators for the Laplacian, the modified Laplacian, the Stokes, the modified Stokes, the Navier, and the modified Navier operators in two and three dimensions. Our numerical results indicate that our method compares very well with the best known implementations of the analytic FMM method for both the Laplacian and modified Laplacian kernels. Its advantage is the (relative) simplicity of the implementation and its immediate extension to more general kernels. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Fong2009,
abstract = {A new O (N) fast multipole formulation is proposed for non-oscillatory kernels. This algorithm is applicable to kernels K (x, y) which are only known numerically, that is their numerical value can be obtained for any (x, y). This is quite different from many fast multipole methods which depend on analytical expansions of the far-field behavior of K, for | x - y | large. Other "black-box" or "kernel-independent" fast multipole methods have been devised. Our approach has the advantage of requiring a small pre-computation time even for very large systems, and uses the minimal number of coefficients to represent the far-field, for a given L2 tolerance error in the approximation. This technique can be very useful for problems where the kernel is known analytically but is quite complicated, or for kernels which are defined purely numerically. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Malhotra2015,
abstract = {We describe our implementation of a parallel fast multipole method for evaluating potentials for discrete and continuous source distributions. The first requires summation over the source points and the second requiring integration over a continuous source density. Both problems require O(N 2) complexity when computed directly ; however, can be accelerated to O(N) time using FMM. In our PVFMM software library, we use kernel independent FMM and this allows us to compute potentials for a wide range of elliptic kernels. Our method is high order, adaptive and scalable. In this paper, we discuss several algorithmic improvements and performance optimizations including cache locality, vectorization, shared memory parallelism and use of coprocessors. Our distributed memory implementation uses space-filling curve for partitioning data and a hypercube communication scheme. We present convergence results for Laplace, Stokes and Helmholtz (low wavenumber) kernels for both particle and volume FMM. We measure efficiency of our method in terms of CPU cycles per unknown for different accuracies and different kernels. We also demonstrate scala-bility of our implementation up to several thousand processor cores on the Stampede platform at the Texas Advanced Computing Center.},

abstract = {An algorithm is presented for the rapid evaluation of the potential and force fields in systems involving large numbers of particles whose interactions are Coulombic or gravitational in nature. For a system of N particles, an amount of work of the order O(N2) has traditionally been required to evaluate all pairwise interactions, unless some approximation or truncation method is used. The algorithm of the present paper requires an amount of work proportional to N to evaluate all interactions to within roundoff error, making it considerably more practical for large-scale problems encountered in plasma physics, fluid dynamics, molecular dynamics, and celestial mechanics. {\textcopyright} 1987.},
